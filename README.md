# ResponsivePortfolio

This is my personal portfolio created to go along with my coding process. As I continue to learn and improve on coding I will making necessary update to the website. Updates such as links to

new website of projects i have worked on or adding new styles and customization the website itself. There are three html page an About, Contact and Portfolio page.  They all have same header

with links to each page and the my name in the header. 

The about page in the body contains an image and short poem that was started based on the picture, which is something i like to do in my spare time. It's something interesting about me you can 

say. 

The contact page has a form for people to submit their contact info with a brief message if necessary. 

The portfolio page has links to different website of projects i have worked on so far.
